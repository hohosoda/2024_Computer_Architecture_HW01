# Assignment1: RISC-V Assembly and Instruction Pipeline

## Introduction
First, Problem c(counting leading zeros) form [quiz 1](https://hackmd.io/@sysprog/2024-arch-homework1) in order to pratice coverting C language to RICS-V assembly. Secondly, three approaches of unsigned interger division are implement by both c language and RISC-V assembly. For the three approches, all of them are verified by [RIPES](https://github.com/mortbopet/Ripes) simulator. Finally, performance of the three apporches are compared and analyzed.
